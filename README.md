## Introduction
This library is a hands-on project, I've done with reference to several excellent component libraries.

If this project has helped you out, please support it with a star🌟.

## Quick start

Introduction part:

<template>
  <div id="app">
    <img alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
    <HelloWorld msg="Welcome to Your Vue.js App"/>
    <w-button>A default button</w-button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import {Button as WButton} from 'wheel-hcjv'

export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    HelloWorld,
    WButton
  }
}
</script>
```

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

## Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
## follow-up work

Through this small trial let me understand the differences between a number of component libraries.

I'll spend the rest of the time refactoring the entire project, adding more components, and trying out multi-terminal compatibility issues.
